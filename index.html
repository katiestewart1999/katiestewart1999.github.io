      <h1>Types of Volcano</h1>
      <p>When magma erupts at the surface it can form different types of volcanoes depending on the<br>
        viscosity, or stickiness, of the magma, the amount of gas in the magma, and the way in which<br>
        the magma reached the surface. The types of volcano include cinder cones, composite volcanoes,<br>
        lava domes and shield volcanoes.</p>
      <br>

      <tr>
        <td><div class="volcano"><img src="../images/composite.jpg" alt="Composite" height="300" width="300"></div></td>
        <td><p>Composite volcanoes<br>
        These are usually the largest volcanoes with steep sides and a symmetrical cone<br>
        shape. They form very thick, viscous and sticky lava that does not flow easily.<br>
        The eruptions are very explosive as the gas can't leave the very thick magma and<br>
        the pressure then builds up.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><div class="volcano"><img src="../images/lava dome.jpg" alt="Lava Dome" height="300" width="300"></div></td>
        <td><p>Lava Dome Volcanoes<br>
        These are usually very rounded and have more gentle slopes. They are formed by the<br>
        slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano. These eruptions are common, <br>
        particularly at a convergent plate boundary. Lava domes are unpredictable due to<br>
        non-linear dynamics.</p></td>

      <tr>
        <td><div class="volcano"><img src="../images/cinder cone.jpg" alt="Cinder Cone" height="300" width="300"></div></td>
        <td><p>Cinder Cone Volcanoes<br>
        These are built from particles and blocks of congealated lava ejected from a <br>
        single vent. As the gas chanrged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks<br>
        into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form<br>
        a circular or oval cone.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><div class="volcano"><img src="../images/shield.jpg" alt="Shield" height="300" width="300"></div></td>
        <td><p>Shield Volcanoes<br>
        These are formed when a volcano produces low viscosity, runny lava that spreads<br>
        far from the source. This forms a volcano with gentle slopes. Shield volcanoes tend<br>
        to be the largest in terms of area as they erupt regularly and for long periods of <br>
        time. This results in lots of layers building up.</p></td>
